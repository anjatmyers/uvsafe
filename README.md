> LayrFive is a collaborative social development site for software engineers. It was designed as a place for developers to share their projects for others to view, rate, and comment. Each user provides their Github username so that developers can view their code. This also provides the opportunity to connect with others through Github, which can be a difficult platform to seek out developers outside your circle. Users are able to filter the main project feed by language in order to target projects they are most interested in.

> UVSafe is a front-end site built with React/Redux. It makes use of an Open Weather API that returns coordinates of the searched city which are needed to make a second API call to the Open UV API for this same location. State is used to pass UV levels and Weather data to separate components to make for a consistent and responsive UI/UX. The design utilized HTML/CSS, React Bootstrap and Adobe Illustrator to make the UVSafe logo.
