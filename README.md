> UVSafe is a front-end site built with React/Redux with the goal of providing helpful information about users' local UV Radiation Levels and encourage them to protect their skin. It makes use of an Open Weather API that returns coordinates of the searched city which are needed to make a second API call to the Open UV API for this same location. State is used to pass UV levels and Weather data to separate components to make for a consistent and responsive UI/UX.
