> UVSafe is a front-end site built with React/Redux. It makes use of an Open Weather API that returns coordinates of the searched city which are needed to make a second API call to the Open UV API for this same location. State is used to pass UV levels and weather data to separate components to make for a consistent and responsive UI/UX. The design utilized HTML/CSS, React Bootstrap and Adobe Illustrator to make the UVSafe logo.

They also can see how long it would take a given skin type to absorb their daily dose of vitamin D in their city. The about page provides helpful tips such as how often to reapply sunscreen.
